1) Cycles are activated correctly
   a)  Cycle throttle is not violated
   b)  The cycle throttle is accurate
   c)  Cycles are activated in chronological order
   d)  If cycledefs change, a) and b) still hold
   e)  c) is true even when cycledefs add new cycles earlier than those already activated
   f)  Ensure that default value of cyclethrottle works properly

2) Cycles are expiring properly
   a) Expiration log messages are written exactly once
   b) Expiration only happens when the cyclelifespan is exceeded for a cycle (Time.now - cycle.activated > cyclelifespan) 
   c) Status of jobs for cycles that have just expired is updated
   d) Jobs for expired cycles that are still running are killed
   e) Log messages for d) are written exactly once
   f) Ensure that default cyclelifespan works properly

3) Task retry is properly enforced
   a) The maxtries for a task is not violated
   b) The retry count for tasks is accurate
   c) A log message for maxtries threshold being reached is written exactly once
   d) Increasing maxtries in XML on the fly allows tasks to run again
   e) Ensure that default maxtries works properly

4) Workflow core throttle is properly enforced
   a) The corethrottle is not violated	
   b) The corethrottle is accurate
   c) A log message for corethrottle violation is accurate
   d) A log message for corethrottle violation is written each time a task is denied submission due to corethrottle violation
   e) Ensure that default corethrottle works properly

5) Workflow task throttle is properly enforced
   a) The taskthrottle is not violated	
   b) The taskthrottle is accurate
   c) A log message for taskthrottle violation is accurate
   d) A log message for taskthrottle violation is written each time a task is denied submission due to taskthrottle violation
   e) Ensure that default taskthrottle works properly

6) Test Workflow servers
   a) Ensure that switches in .wfmrc correctly switch use of various servers on/off
   b) Ensure that WFM operates correctly with servers off
   c) Ensure that WFM operates correctly with servers on
   d) Test robustness of workflow servers

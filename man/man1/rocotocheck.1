.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool to query detailed information about a specific task for a specific
cycle of a specific Rocoto workflow.
.Pp
The rocotocheck command is particularly useful for determining why a particular 
task cannot be submitted.  Rocotocheck reports which dependencies are satisfied
and which are not, as well as any throttle violations that are preventing a 
task from being submitted.
.Pp
The rocotocheck command requires four arguments. The 
.Cm -w
flag specifies the name
of the workflow definition file. The 
.Cm -d
flag specifies the name of the database file
that contains the state of the workflow to be queried. 
The
.Cm -t
flag specifies the task name to query. The
.Cm -c
flag specifies the appropriate cycle number.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl -version
Display the version number and exit.
.It Fl h, -help
Display a short help message and exit.
.It Fl v, -verbose Ar #
Run Rocoto in verbose mode with the specified level. If no level is
specified a level of 1 is used.
.It Fl d, -database Ar file
The path to the Rocoto database file for the workflow to be queried.
.It Fl w, -workflow Ar file
The path to the Rocoto workflow file to be queried.
.It Fl t, -task Ar taskname

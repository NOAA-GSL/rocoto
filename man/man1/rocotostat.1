.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool for querying the status of tasks or cycles in an active Rocoto
workflow.  The summary level status information provides an overview
of a workflow's execution progress.  There are  options that can be used
to query the state of the specific sets of cycles and/or tasks that are
of interest.  By default,
.Nm
will display the state of all tasks in the workflow for the most recently
activated cycle.  
.Pp
The status information displayed for tasks includes: the job id, the task's
current state, the task's exit status, and the number of task tries.  
.Pp
The status information displayed for cycles includes: the cycle's current state,
when the cycle was activated, and when the cycle was deactivated.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command requires two arguments. The
.Cm -w
flag specifies the name
of the workflow definition file. The
.Cm -d
flag specifies the name of the database file
that contains the state of the workflow that is to be queried.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl -version
Display the version number and exit.
.It Fl h, -help
Display a short help message and exit.
.It Fl v, -verbose Ar #
Run Rocoto in verbose mode with the specified level. If no level is
specified a level of 1 is used.
.It Fl d, -database Ar file
The path to the Rocoto database file for the workflow containing the task to be stated.
.It Fl w, -workflow Ar file
The path to the Rocoto workflow file defining the task that is to be stated
.It Fl t, -task Ar taskspec
The tasks to query
.It Fl c, -cycle Ar cyclespec
The cycles to query
.It Fl s
Print a cycle status summary
.It Fl T
Sort the output by taskname instead of cycle
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
.Ic "rocotostat -d foo.db -w foo.xml -t wrf -c 201301010000"
